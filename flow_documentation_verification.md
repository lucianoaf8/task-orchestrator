# Flow Documentation Verification (Task 8)

Date: 2025-06-18 23:40 (local)

This document cross-checks the **implemented codebase & validated behaviour** against the flow requirements described in `changes-validations.md` and `summary-of-changes.md` **without executing any additional commands**, relying on:

* Static inspection of the current source tree
* Evidence gathered during Tasks 1-7

---

| Requirement | Evidence (Static / Prior tests) | Status |
|-------------|---------------------------------|--------|
| **1. `orc.py` exists as unified entry point** | â€¢ File present at project root (see tree in `project_structure.md`).<br>â€¢ Help banner shows all four operations as captured in Task 1 report. | âœ… |
| **2. `main.py` calls `orc.py --schedule`** | â€¢ Function `trigger_orc_scheduling()` (lines 22-34 in `main.py`) invokes:<br>`subprocess.run([sys.executable, 'orc.py', '--schedule', task_name])`.<br>â€¢ Interactive mode and CLI flow both call this helper. | âœ… |
| **3. Web API calls `orc.py` via subprocess** | â€¢ `orchestrator/web/api/routes.py` defines `call_orc_py()` which builds `cmd = [sys.executable, 'orc.py', ...]` and is used by endpoints `/tasks`, `/schedule`, `/unschedule`, `/tasks/scheduled`.<br>â€¢ Task 6 runtime validation confirmed these endpoints work. | âœ… |
| **4. Windows scheduled tasks execute `orc.py --task`** | â€¢ `orchestrator/utils/windows_scheduler.py -> create_task()` assembles command:<br>`cmd /c "cd /d <root> && "<python>" "<root>/orc.py" --task <name>"`.<br>â€¢ Task 4 tests showed XML contains `orc.py --task test_validation`. | âœ… |
| **5. Complete flow works end-to-end** | â€¢ Task 5 (`complete_flow_test.py`) ran: create âžœ schedule âžœ execute âžœ log âžœ cleanup â€” now passes after history-persistence fix.<br>â€¢ Task 7 (`final_system_validation.py`) demonstrates the same for `final_test`. | âœ… |

## Compliance Result

All documented flow checkpoints are satisfied â†’ **100 % FLOW COMPLIANT** ðŸŽ‰

No discrepancies were found between code implementation and the documented architecture/behaviour.
