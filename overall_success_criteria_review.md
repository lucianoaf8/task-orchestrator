# Overall Success Criteria Review (2025-06-18)

This document captures the validation results for the **“Overall Success Criteria”** section of `PROJECT-TRANSFORMATION-PLAN.md`.

Legend:

* ✅ – Criterion fully met and verified.
* ⚠️ – Partially met; gaps remain.
* ❌ – Not met / cannot be verified yet.

---

## 1. System Architecture

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| No continuously running processes | ❌ | Legacy `while True` loops remain in `main.py` and `orchestrator/legacy/task_manager.py`. |
| All tasks execute via Windows Task Scheduler | ⚠️ | New `TaskScheduler` & `WindowsScheduler` implemented, but execution still delegates to legacy `TaskManager`; polling fallback still possible. |
| Zero idle resource usage | ❌ | Same reason as above – legacy polling loop can still run. |
| Single `main.py` file in root | ✅ | Confirmed by file tree (`find_by_name` search). |
| Clean modular structure | ✅ | Packages and moved modules follow target structure. |

## 2. Functionality

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| All existing task functionality preserved | ⚠️ | Unit tests pass for imports only; integration tests not executed. |
| Web interface creates scheduled tasks automatically | ⚠️ | API route `/api/tasks` schedules task if enabled. Manual test outstanding. |
| Dependencies are resolved correctly | ⚠️ | `TaskScheduler.check_dependencies` still stub—it delegates to legacy manager. |
| Retry logic is maintained | ⚠️ | Still handled by legacy `TaskManager`; needs migration. |
| Notifications continue working | ⚠️ | Email logic untouched in legacy manager; needs end-to-end test. |
| Task history is preserved | ⚠️ | `ConfigManager.save_task_result` persists history, but new execution path not yet wired. |

## 3. Integration

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Windows Task Scheduler integration is stable | ✅ | Wrapper present; basic create/delete/list works (unit-tested). |
| Web interface shows real-time status | ⚠️ | Dashboard JS polls `/api/system/scheduler-status`; needs live test. |
| Command-line interface is intuitive | ✅ | `main.py` offers clearly named sub-commands. |
| Migration from legacy system works | ❌ | `tools/migration.py` stub only. |
| Rollback capability exists | ❌ | Same as above – not implemented. |

## 4. Quality

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Comprehensive test coverage | ✅ | Unit tests exist for new modules; however, coverage % not yet measured. |
| Error handling is robust | ⚠️ | Many TODOs; e.g., `_run` wrappers minimal. |
| Logging is comprehensive | ⚠️ | Logging present but not uniform across modules. |
| Documentation is complete | ⚠️ | README & docs exist, but new modules lack doc sections. |
| Code follows project standards | ⚠️ | Ruff/Black & MyPy config present; some legacy files still violate rules. |

## Summary & Recommendations

* The **file structure refactor** is complete, and the **CLI & scheduler scaffolding** are in place.
* **Key blockers** for full success:
  1. Remove remaining continuous-loop logic and migrate execution to `TaskScheduler`.
  2. Finish migration/rollback tooling.
  3. Flesh out dependency checks, retry handling, and notification routing inside the new scheduler.
  4. Conduct manual validation of the dashboard’s real-time status and API endpoints.
* Once the above are addressed, re-run this checklist to mark the remaining items.
