## Task 4 – Validate *Windows Task Scheduler* Integration ✅

| Check | Command | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Python validation snippet | `python -c "..."` | `Task creation success: True` |
| Verify task exists | `schtasks /query /tn "\Orchestrator\Orc_test_validation"` | Exit-code **0** – task present |
| Verify command contains `orc.py` | `schtasks ... /xml | findstr "orc.py"` | `<Arguments> ... orc.py" --task test_validation` found |
| Cleanup | `schtasks /delete /tn ...` | Exit-code **0** – task deleted |

**Pass criteria met.**  Windows tasks are being created with the correct `orc.py --task` command and cleanly removed.

---

## Task 5 – Validate *Complete End-to-End Flow* ❌

The scripted test `complete_flow_test.py` was executed exactly as specified.  Output excerpt:

```text
=== Complete Flow Validation Test ===
Step 1: Creating and scheduling test task...
✓ Task saved to database
✓ Task 'flow_test_task' scheduled successfully
✓ Scheduling via orc.py succeeded

Step 2: Verifying Windows Task...
✓ Windows Task exists

Step 3: Testing task execution...
✗ Task execution failed: 

❌ COMPLETE FLOW TEST FAILED
```

Running `python orc.py --task flow_test_task` manually returns exit-code **1** and logs the following (abridged):

```
INFO - Executing task: flow_test_task
ERROR - Error executing task flow_test_task: No module named 'orchestrator.legacy'
```

### Root Cause Analysis
* `orc.py` ➔ `TaskScheduler.execute_task()` imports `orchestrator.legacy.task_manager.TaskManager`.
* The `orchestrator.legacy` package was **removed** during refactorisation; therefore the import fails and execution aborts.

### Impact
* Any scheduled task triggered via Windows or direct `orc.py --task` will fail.
* Blocks complete end-to-end validation and Tasks 6-8.

### Recommendations
1. Replace legacy execution path with the new implementation (or
   re-introduce a shim) so `TaskScheduler.execute_task()` does **not** rely on
   `orchestrator.legacy`.
2. Add a regression test to ensure `orc.py --task <name>` runs successfully for
   a minimal echo task.
3. Re-run Task 5 once the execution path is fixed; only then proceed to Task 6.

## Current Status (after Tasks 4-5)
* **Task 4:** Passed
* **Task 5:** Failed – **blocker** (execution path broken)
* Tasks 6-8: **Not executed** pending resolution of Task 5 failure.
