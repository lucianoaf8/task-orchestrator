# Flow Alignment Validation Report

Date: 2025-06-18 22:57 (local)

## Overview
This document records the results of executing the validation checklist defined in `changes-validations.md`.
The validations were executed exactly in the prescribed order. Where a step failed, the remaining steps were **not** executed, per process requirements.

---

## Task 1 – Validate `orc.py` Entry-Point Creation ✅
| Check | Command | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| File exists | `ls orc.py` | `orc.py` present (6 343 bytes) |
| Help output | `python orc.py --help` | Displays all four operations (`--schedule`, `--task`, `--list`, `--unschedule`) |
| Schedule non-existent task | `python orc.py --schedule non_existent_task` | Returns exit-code 1 and clear error *"Task non_existent_task not found in database"* |
| List operation | `python orc.py --list` | Executes without crash; shows *No tasks currently scheduled* |

**Pass criteria met.**  Task 1 is fully compliant.

---

## Task 2 – Validate `main.py` Flow Integration ❌
Validation aborted on the **first** checklist command.

| Check | Command | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| CLI help | `python main.py cli --help` | **Failed** – uncaught `NameError: name 'api_bp' is not defined` raised from `orchestrator/web/api/routes.py` line 33 |

Because the very first check failed, subsequent Task 2 checks were **not executed**.

### Error Trace (excerpt)
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Projects\task-python-orchestrator\main.py", line 234, in <module>
    main()
  File "C:\Projects\task-python-orchestrator\main.py", line 221, in main
    from orchestrator.cli import cli_main
  File "...\orchestrator\cli.py", line 13, in <module>
    from orchestrator.web.dashboard import main as dashboard_main
  File "...\orchestrator\web\__init__.py", line 4, in <module>
    from .api.routes import api_bp
  File "...\orchestrator\web\api\routes.py", line 33, in <module>
    @api_bp.post("/tasks")
NameError: name 'api_bp' is not defined
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The module `orchestrator/web/api/routes.py` references the Flask `Blueprint` instance `api_bp`, but this symbol is **never defined** in the file or imported from another module.  Additional helper symbols (`_json`, `_success`, `_validate_cron`, `CM`, `request`) are referenced later and likewise undefined.

This indicates an incomplete refactor: the earlier blueprint definition (e.g. `api_bp = Blueprint('api', __name__, url_prefix='/api')`) and utility imports were removed or not copied.

### Impact
* `main.py` fails to import, breaking all CLI operations.
* Web API cannot be registered, so Tasks 3, 5, 6, 7 cannot proceed.
* Overall flow compliance currently **blocked**.

### Recommended Fixes
1. Re-introduce the missing blueprint and helpers at the top of `routes.py`, e.g.:
   ```python
   from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify

   api_bp = Blueprint("api", __name__, url_prefix="/api")
   from orchestrator.core.config_manager import ConfigManager
   CM = ConfigManager()

   def _json(payload, status):
       return jsonify(payload), status

   def _success(payload, status=200):
       payload.setdefault("status", "success")
       return _json(payload, status)
   ```
2. Ensure `_validate_cron` function is either defined locally or imported from an existing utilities module.
3. Add unit/pytest coverage for module import of `orchestrator.web` to catch such issues.

---

## Current Status
* **Task 1:** Passed
* **Task 2:** Failed – **blocker**
* Tasks 3-8: **Not executed** pending resolution of Task 2 failure.

---

## Next Steps
1. Address the missing definitions in `orchestrator/web/api/routes.py`.
2. Re-run Task 2 validation commands.
3. Once Task 2 passes, continue with Task 3 and subsequent tasks in sequence.
